kitty config?
kitty jetbrains mono in terminal
waybar
	- volume (https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar/wiki/Module:-PulseAudio-Slider -> pulseaudio)
	- tray with workspaces next to it looks ugly
	- fix "no-controller" on bt widget
	- middle waybar cell should be gone when empty
fix dynamic-cursor plugin
Decode on pywal
	- pywalfox too much imo
	- sometimes pywal colors ugly, perhaps another system
	- with static background color it's kind of OK, try it out for now

screenshot editing  & image viewing -> swappy is too slow, pinta crashes, swayimg is weird
tumbler for thumbnails
ranger?
fix bug where many waybars are spawned after a while in locked state - I think this is fixed now
